The workshop is organised by the [LIBRE hub project](https://librehub.github.io/) and is the result of a collaboration and support by a number of individuals and CZI funded initiatives driving access to bioimaging research capabilities, including individuals from [Napari](https://napari.org/stable/), [Latin America
Bioimaging](https://labi.lat/es/), [Mexico Bioimaging](https://meximagingworkshops.org.mx),and available online material. We would like to thank the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/imaging/latin-american-hub-for-bioimaging-through-open-hardware/) for financial support through the [LIBRE hub project](https://librehub.github.io/) and the other participating initiatives.
