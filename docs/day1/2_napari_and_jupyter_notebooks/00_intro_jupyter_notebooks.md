In this part, we will open jupyter notebooks using JupyterLab and run a few lines of Python code there. We will also open napari from the jupyter notebook, add images to it and control some viewer parameters from code. At the same time, we will manually change some settings in viewer and get these changes back in variables inside the jupyter notebook.
