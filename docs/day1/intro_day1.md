Welcome to our Quantiative Bio-Image Analysis using Python course! In the first session we get to know each other and do a little Python Quiz.

[Slides](https://github.com/BiAPoL/Image-data-science-with-Python-and-Napari-EPFL2022/raw/main/docs/day1/Introduction_Course.pdf).

Afterwards, we will go through some Python basics and the main concepts of scientific bio-image analysis. In the afternoon, we do the first steps of typical bio-image analysis workflows: open and display images. For multi-dimensional data, we introduce you to napari, a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. By the end of the day we will demonstrate how image processing filters work and we will apply a few of them to reduce noise, background or enhance edges.
