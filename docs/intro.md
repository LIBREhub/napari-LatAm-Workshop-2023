# Image data science for with Python and Napari

A first Latin America workshop #LIBREhub @napari #MexicoBioimaging

This [Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/) contains training resources for scientists who want to dive into image processing with Python and Napari. 
It specifically aims for scientists and students working with microscopy images in the life sciences.
We presume the attendees have some basic python programming and image analysis knowledge. 
To get everyone on the same level, we start with Python programming basics.
We will process images using [numpy](https://numpy.org), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/), [SimpleITK](https://simpleitk.org/) and [clEsperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype).
We will explore [Napari](https://napari.org) for interactive image data analysis and the [Napari-Assistant](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-assistant) for generating [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) from interactively designed image processing workflows. 

**Note:** 
Before the course starts, all partcipants are required to have Napari and Jupyter installed, [please see the course preparation page](https://librehub.github.io/napari-LatAm-workshop-2023/day0/pre-requirements/to_be_installed.html) - and make use of the [napari chatroom for troubleshooting](https://napari.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/393209-napari-latam-workshop-2023/) if you face installation issues.

## How to use this material

For following the course, we recommend downloading [the repository from which this Jupyter book is made](https://github.com/LIBREhub/napari-LatAm-workshop-2023).
All Jupyter Notebooks are executable so that attendees can reproduce all demos and exercises.

Assuming you downloaded the repository to your Desktop, you can open the Jupyter book by opening a terminal and typing:

```bash
cd Desktop/napari-LatAm-Workshop-2023

conda activate devbio-napari-env

jupyter lab
```
If you do not yet have conda or devbio-napari-env installed, first follow the "Course preparation" installation instructions on the next page.

Using Jupyter lab, you can navigate to the course lessons in the `docs` folder.
