This [Jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/) contains training resources for scientists who want to dive into image processing with Python. 
It specifically aims for students and scientists working with microscopy images in the life sciences.
We presume the attendees have some basic programming and image analysis knowledge. 
To get everyone on the same level, we start with Python programming basics.
We will process images using [numpy](https://numpy.org), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/), [SimpleITK](https://simpleitk.org/) and [clEsperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype).
We will explore [Napari](https://napari.org) for interactive image data analysis and the [Napari-Assistant](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-assistant) for generating [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) from interactively designed image processing workflows.

## How to use this material

For following the course, we recommend downloading [the repository from which this Jupyter book is made](https://github.com/LIBREhub/Image-data-science-with-Napari-and-Python-LatAm2023).
All Jupyter Notebooks are executable so that attendees can reproduce all demos and exercises.

Assuming you downloaded the repository to your Desktop, you can open the Jupyter book by opening a terminal and typing:

```bash
cd Desktop/Image-data-science-with-Napari-and-Python-LatAm2023

conda activate devbio-napari-env

jupyter lab
```

Using Jupyter lab, you can navigate to the course lessons in the `docs` folder.
