# Opening and Displaying with Images in Python

In this section, we will show you how to open images in python and a few ways to display them in a jupyter notebook. We start with [imread function from scikit-image.io](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.io.html#skimage.io.imread), which can open standard image formats like '.tif' and '.png'. Then we show how ways to display images side-by-side in a single figure. Finally, we show you how to work with multichannel images and an example with proprietary formats. As a bonus part, we also show how to install an additional python package to an existing conda environment.

The slides for this section can be found [here](https://github.com/BiAPoL/Image-data-science-with-Python-and-Napari-EPFL2022/raw/main/docs/day2b_Working_with_Images/Reading%20and%20Visualizing%20Images.pdf).

We will also interact with napari from jupyter notebooks. napari is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python, and it is designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images.

We also show an example of how to set up a simple 3D image processing workflow in a Jupyter notebook using napari.
